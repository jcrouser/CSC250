<h1>About the Zodiac Killer</h1>
<p>The Zodiac Killer was a serial killer active in the late 60s and early 70s. He was based in California and usually targeted young couples in secluded areas or people who were alone at night. It is known that he killed at least 5 people, but he claimed to have murdered a total of 37. The Zodiac Killer gained notoriety through his public communication with law enforcement and newspapers. He communicated with them through phone calls, letters, and <q>cryptograms</q> (which are coded letters with revealing information about him). When the first cryptogram was received, the police and investigators weren&#39;t able to crack it after working endlessly on it. However, the cryptogram was printed in the newspaper (after a threat from the Zodiac Killer) and subsequently decrypted by 2 school teachers named Bettye and Donald Harden after 20 hours of working on it. </p>

<p>The Zodiac Killer may not have liked the fact that his first cryptogram was solved so quickly. Thus, his following 3 cryptograms were much harder and more complex than the first one. 49 years later, they remain partially solved from a combination of police and detective work, and AI software (like Carmel). Their difficulty is a result of clever encryption methods the Zodiac Killer used, some of which include the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>If the word <q>KILL</q> appeared, the pair of Ls would be encrypted as two different symbols to make it harder to locate.</li>
<li>He would encrypt 8 meaningful lines of text followed by several lines of gibberish.</li>
<li>He left half of the alphabet unchanged.</li>
<li>He had 2 symbols stand for A and S.</li>
<li>He made a lot of spelling errors which made decryption so much harder because no one knew exactly what message he wanted to convey.</li>
<li>He kept cryptogram #3 and #4 quite short. This proved problematic because the encryption could have multiple meanings.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Historical, Cultural, and Real-world significance</h2>
<p>The Zodiac Killer&#39;s identity was never identified and no one knows if he is still alive today. Culturally, he inspired many films, books, and movies. He absolutely terrified the public and had them in the palm of his hands during the 60s and 70s. While the Zodiac Killer revealed pertinent information about himself, made phone calls to the police, and had sketches of himself that could be used to identify him, alas, he still eluded capture. Today, it is unknown whether the murders connected to him were solely done by him or if he worked with others. He may have inspired other serial killers, one of which may be the Golden State Killer who was identified in April 2018 and arrested. The Golden State Killer grew up in the same time period when the Zodiac Killer was active; he was known to go by different monikers in order to elude police capture. A commenter on reddit stated it best when he said,
  <q>a lot of sociopaths who wanted to kill restrain themselves because they never thought it was a real option. After seeing [the] Zodiac [Killer] play this part of a comic book super villain very publicly, a lot of sociopaths realized that they could really carry out [their]...violent fantasies.</q>

<h2>Discussion - Shortcomings and areas for improvement </h2>
<p>After learning about the Zodiac Killer, I found his encryption techniques clever. Whether he intended to or not, his use of many grammatical errors in his cryptograms made them basically impossible to decipher. This is good and bad. It&#39;s good because they were not (and still are not) easily broken, but it&#39;s bad because people will never be sure nor can they ever fully figure out the messages that he wanted to convey. I also found it intriguing that he was able to escape capture. How is that even possible? He gave the public so much information about him! This indicates that he was of above average intelligence and knew what he was doing. Additionally, the police had many shortcomings. It&#39;s understandable given the technology at the time (1960s-70s). They were not able to accurately trace his calls nor identify DNA on his letters. If there were another killer like him today, I wonder if he or she would be able to avoid capture because forensic technology has advanced so much.
