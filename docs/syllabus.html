<h1 class="title toc-ignore">Syllabus</h1>

</div>


<p>This course provides a challenging introduction to some of the core
theoretical ideas that underlie the computational sciences. Through
successful completion of this course, you will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Develop an understanding of “computer science outside the box” – to
begin to think of CS not only as the science of <em>computers</em>, but
as the science of <strong>what can be computed</strong>.</li>
<li>Demonstrate familiarity with key concepts in logic, proofs, and the
definitions of multiple computational paradigms.</li>
<li>Explain core computer science topics, such as automata, grammars,
Turing machines, complexity, and more.</li>
<li>Propose algorithms in order to transform and analyze problems using
the tools and structures we will develop in class.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<div id="course-materials" class="section level2">

</div>
<div id="communication-expectations" class="section level2">
<h2>Communication expectations</h2>
<p>All written communication regarding this course will take place via
slack.
<!--[slack](https://smi-csc250-01-202103.slack.com){target="_blank"} (a cloud-based team
collaboration tool used by many tech companies for internal communication).-->
This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>announcements (in the <a href="" target="_blank">#general</a>
channel)</li>
<li>questions about the material (in the <a href=""
target="_blank">#questions</a> channel)</li>
<li>messages between individual students and the instructor (via DM to
<span class="citation">@jordan</span>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Even if you’re not used to slack at first, it’s not too hard to
learn. The advantages of having all course communications in one place
are compelling. Use slack!</p>
<hr>
</div>
<div id="what-well-cover" class="section level2">
<h2>What We’ll Cover</h2>
<ul>
<li>We’ll begin with very simple computational machinery (automata and
finite state machines, regular sets, context-free languages).</li>
<li>Next, we’ll move on to Turing machines and computability, efficient
algorithms and reducibility, NP-completeness, the P versus NP problem,
the power of randomness.</li>
<li>Time permitting, we’ll draw on real world examples from the domains
of cryptography, machine learning, and more.</li>
<li>Finally, we’ll talk about the present and future of computing
theory, with potential topics including interactive proofs, quantum
computing and the physical limits of computation.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="what-we-wont-cover" class="section level2">
<h2>What We <strong>Won’t</strong> Cover</h2>
<p>This course assumes that you have a solid foundation in computational
thinking, either through successful completion of CSC110, high school
curriculum at at AP or IB level, or dedicated self-study. We also assume
that you are familiar with logical reasoning and writing proofs, to the
degree that it is covered in courses like MTH153: Discrete Mathematics.
Check out the following links to supplemental online courses through
LinkedIn Learning if you’d like some additional support, which are
available for free to all members of the Smith community:</p>

<li><a
href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning/programming-foundations-fundamentals-3">Programming
Foundations: Fundamentals</a> <br/> <sup>Been awhile since you took 110?
This 2hr crash course will remind you of the key points. Taught in
Python.</sup></li>
<li><a
href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning/programming-foundations-discrete-mathematics/welcome?u=50599105">Programming
Foundations: Discrete Mathematics</a> <br/> <sup>Feeling a little rusty
on Discrete Math? This 3hr course covers many of the topics and
techniques you’ll need for this course.</sup></li>
</ul>
<hr>
</div>
<div id="class-mechanics" class="section level2">
<h2>Class Mechanics</h2>
<p>We will discuss concepts using blackboard annotations as well as
projected presentations, animations, and videos.</p>
<p>Optional readings will be available and are recommended material
before each designated lecture. This will help prepare you for the day’s
discussion.</p>
<p>Friday classes will be used to practice the techniques seen during
the week by solving exercises and discussing subjects that remain
confusing. This will include a weekly <strong>Understanding
Check</strong> – a low-stakes, in-class exercise designed to see how
weel we are able to transfer the week’s topic to new (but similar)
problems.</p>
<p>Note: class participation is important, as the class will include
discussion and debate about many of these topics.</p>
<hr>
</div>
<div id="assignments" class="section level2">
<h2>Assignments</h2>
<p>There will be 10 problem sets assigned during the semester. Problem
sets will be due before class on Fridays. These problem sets will often
ask you to prove theorems, but it is more important to demonstrate
understanding than to employ rigor for rigor’s sake. For example: a
brief description of an algorithm including an illustrative diagram is
better than complicated spaghetti code. Additionally, a clear
explanation of how you tried to solve a problem and were unsuccessful
will receive partial credit.</p>
<p>Use the following checklist to guide your answers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is my answer <strong>Correct</strong>? (if not, re work it until you
find the correct answer)</li>
<li>Is my answer <strong>Complete</strong>? (if not, explore edge cases
and possible gaps in your logic)</li>
<li>Is my answer <strong>Concise</strong>? (if not, find a way to
explain it in fewer words/steps)</li>
<li>Is my answer <strong>Clear</strong>? (if not, re-word it or add an
illustration that clarifies your meaning)</li>
</ul>
<p>All assignments must be submitted in PDF format, and should be
organized and legible (typed is preferable). For convenience, a LaTeX
template will be provided for each assignment.</p>
<hr>
</div>
<div id="collaboration-and-academic-integrity" class="section level2">
<h2>Collaboration and Academic Integrity</h2>
<p>Students are strongly encouraged to form study groups and to
collaborate on problem sets, though each student will be required to
write up and submit their solutions independently. The following
information is required for all submitted work:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The names of all collaborating students be listed at the top of the
submission. If you worked alone, please state: “<em>I did not
collaborate with anyone on this assignment.</em>”</li>
<li>A “<strong>References</strong>” section, with in-line citations to
any resources you used. Citations should include page numbers (if a
printed resource) or a direct URL (if an online resource). If you did
not use any resources in completing the assignment, please state: “<em>I
did not utilize any external resources in completing this
assignment.</em>”</li>
</ol>
<div id="use-of-ai-tools-with-attribution" class="section level3">
<h3>Use of AI Tools with Attribution</h3>
<p>In this course, students are permitted to utilize AI-powered tools,
provided you do so while adhering to responsible and ethical practices.
These tools can provide valuable assistance in enhancing your
proof-writing efficiency and proficiency. You are permitted to
incorporate AI suggestions into your assignments and projects, as long
as proper attribution is given. <strong><em>Generative AI (e.g. ChatGPT
or similar) cannot be used for written reflections, understanding
checks, or exams in CSC250.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Guidelines for Using AI Tools:</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Attribution:</strong> We’ll treat AI tools as
“collaborators” in this class. Whenever you get help with your
assignment, it is crucial to provide clear and transparent attribution.
Include a comment or annotation in your code specifying that certain
sections were generated with the help of AI.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Originality:</strong> While AI can offer valuable
insights and suggestions, it is important that the final code reflects
<em>your</em> understanding of the material. For this reason, you should
avoid copying generated code without understanding what it does;
instead, use it as a reference to enhance your own skills.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Learning Opportunity:</strong> View AI as a supplementary
learning resource. Take the time to assess the suggestions provided by
the tool and compare them to your own intuition. This process can
contribute to a deeper understanding of the concepts we cover.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Honor Code:</strong> Always prioritize academic
integrity. Plagiarism, which includes submitting someone else’s work
(including AI-generated content) without proper attribution, is a
violation of our community’s ethical standards and course
policy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Discussion and Collaboration:</strong> While using AI
tools, feel free to engage in discussions with peers and instructors
about the generated output and how it aligns with course concepts.
Collaborative learning and constructive feedback can enrich the
educational experience.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Diverse Approaches:</strong> Keep in mind that there are
generally many “right” ways to solve a programming problem. AI-generated
suggestions might present one approach, but exploring alternative
solutions on your own or through discussions is highly
encouraged.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Human Power:</strong> All AI is developed by other humans
and trained on data generated by millions of our peers. Generative AI
regurgitates and remixes existing information. Do not be fooled into
thinking it “knows” more than you.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Remember: the primary goal of this course is to enhance your skills
and understanding of the subject matter. Utilizing AI tools with
attribution can support this goal, but the responsibility lies with you
to ensure that your work reflects your own efforts and
comprehension.</p>

<div id="policy-on-late-work" class="section level2">
<h2>Policy on Late Work</h2>
<p>Because we will review assignments together each Friday during class,
late homework will not be accepted for credit unless arrangements for an
extension are made in advance (though you’re welcome to submit it for
qualitative feedback). Not having completed an assignment on time means
you won’t be able to participate in Friday’s exercises, and this is
where much of the actual learning happens. Submitting what you were able
to get done is <strong>always</strong> better than submitting
nothing.</p>
<p>While staying on top of your work in this class is important, we also
have the following ``stress release’’ policies in place:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are <em>overwhelmed</em>, come talk to me <strong>before the
due date</strong> and we will find a solution.</li>
<li>If something <strong>catastrophic</strong> happens, contact your
Class Dean and we’ll work together to arrange alternative deadlines that
make sense for your individual circumstances.</li>
</ul>
<div id="recovery-modes" class="section level3">
<h3>Recovery modes:</h3>
<p>That said, sometimes life happens. We will have a few ways of
alleviating grade pressure:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your lowest score in HW01-HW08 will be dropped.</li>
<li>Your lowest score in the Understanding Checks through Week 11 will
be dropped.</li>
</ul>

<div id="accessibility-accommodations" class="section level2">
<h2>Accessibility &amp; Accommodations</h2>
<p>We aim to make this course accessible to all and welcome feedback
about changes we can make to meet that goal. If you encounter barriers
to participation in this or any other course, please <a
href="https://www.smith.edu/about-smith/disability-services/register">register
with the Disability Services Office</a> to request support and
accommodations.</p>
<hr>
</div>
<div id="comfy-class-policy" class="section level2">
<h2>Comfy Class Policy</h2>
<p>Everyone is welcome to make themselves comfortable in our classroom
and asked to be respectful of one another. When you are communicating,
please practice active listening by focusing on understanding what
others are expressing rather than thinking of how you will respond.
Additionally, keep in mind that our wide array of individual backgrounds
shape our unique perspectives, so please respect one another when we
have sincere differences of opinion.</p>
<p>You may bring beverages or snacks, but please use closed containers
to avoid spills and keep messy foods away from computers. Everyone is
free to use concentration accommodations like fidget toys, knitting,
doodling, moving around, or sitting on the floor; just be mindful your
focus does not disrupt others. Parents and caregivers may bring their
babies and children to class whenever necessary. Learners of all stages
are invited to join us.</p>
