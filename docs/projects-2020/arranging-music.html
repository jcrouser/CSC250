<h1>Computational Complexity of Arranging Music</h1>
<h4>By: Isabella Brody-Calixto, Aurora Lopez, Hana Sambora</h4>

<div>
<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>In their paper <a href = "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.04220.pdf">"Computational Complexity of Arranging Music"</a> William S. Moses and Erik D. Demaine pose the question: “How do various constraints affect the computational complexity of arranging music originally written for one set of instruments down to a single instrument?” This question can be applied to rhythm games and choreography. Assuming that NP != P, arranging music using each of the three constraints is NP-complete.</p>
</div>

<div>
<h2>Arranging music</h2>
<p>Playing a piece of music written for one set of instruments on another usually requires some modification. Moses and Demaine give the following formal definition of an arrangement: "A set of musical parts T = {T0, T1, . . . } consisting of musical notes played at specific times, can be arranged or rewritten for a single part, when subject to various constraints..."</p>

<h2>Types of constraints</h2>
<h3>Specific:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Consonance</li>
<p>We only want to produce pleasant-sounding chords in the arrangement, although some songs have a small number of dissonant chords.</p>

<li>Simultaneous Note Limitations</li>
<p>Depending on the instrument the arrangement is for, there are restrictions on how many notes can appear in one chord. For example, a flutist would only be able to play one notes at a time while a pianist could play up to 10 simultaneously. Additionally, for a less skilled player, the maximum number of notes in a chord may have to be decreased.</p>

<li>Transition Speed Limitations</li>
<p>Changing notes too quickly is physically impossible for any musician, so the arrangement must be made with this in mind.</p>
</ul>

<h3>Universal:</h3>
<ul>
<li>No Splitting Melodies</li>
<p>Each individual part Ti  must be included or excluded in entirety. This means all notes/rhythms in the original part Ti must be included or all will not be. So, we do not want to break any melodies in the middle. For example, we would want to include all syllables in “Twinkle Twinkle Little Star” to ensure that the melody is still recognizable.</p>

<li>Percentage of Notes in an Arrangement</li>
<p>In order for the arrangement to still be recognizable, a certain percentage of notes at any time t in the original song must be preserved in the arrangement.</p>
</ul>

<h2>Constraint #1: Consonance</h2>
<p>In order to show that ensuring consonance is NP-hard, the authors demonstrate a reduction from 3SAT. 3SAT is the question: for any
propositional statement that consists of "and"-ing at least two clauses of at least three literals "or"-ed together, are there a set of truth values for the
literals that renders the whole statement true? As an example, here is a statement that would qualify for 3SAT: ((X1 OR X2 OR !X1) AND (X3 OR X4 OR X5)).
The reduction from 3SAT consists of 3 parts.</p>
<h4>Variable Gadget</h4>
<p>The point of the variable gadget is to ensure that each variable has distinct true and false values, allowing us to represent the literals in 3SAT. This is done by assigning each variable two
melodies. These melodies are in dissonance so they can't be played at the same time. For the time being, let us assume, regarding the constraint that some
percentage of notes must be playing at all times, that p = 50%. Therefore, at least one of the melodies assigned to each variable must be playing at any given time.
 In other words, the variable must always either have a true or false value to have a valid arrangement. </p>
<h4>True and False Literals</h4>
<p>The variable gadget thus established, we can now create musical parts (literals) that are guaranteed to have a true or false value at any given time and ensure that the only true part will be played in its entirety.
We do this by having a measure where only the true part has notes. Recall that p = 50%. Therefore, the true part must be played during that measure, and must not exclude any of the notes in the part.
The variable gadget can be applied between this true literal and another literal intended to be false. By the rules of the gadget, only the true part can be played.
</p>
<h4>Clause Gadget</h4>
<p>Finally, we can use the above information to create a clause gadget that ensures at least one literal and its variables in the  3SAT clause  must be true, creating a consonant arrangement and satisfying 3SAT.
For each clause gadget there are 3 variable gadgets and one true literal. Any of the variables being true corresponds to the true literal being played.
A measure can be created where only the true literal is playing notes. Because at least half of all notes must be played, at least one of the literals in the clause must be true.
</p>
<h3>Generalizing p</h3>
<p>You may have noticed that 50% is an arbitrary percentage of notes to define the constraint that some percentage of the original song must be present for it to be recognizable.
In fact, this percentage could vary wildly from song to song and be anywhere from 1-100%. Changing the value of p requires padding each clause gadget with true or false literals.
To determine how many true and false literals are needed, the following equation can be used: if the gadget is padded by t true literals and f false liters, if no variables of the clause are true,
t/(t+f+3) notes are being played. Since this would not be a satisfying arrangement, t/(t+f+3) must be strictly less than p. If one variable is true, then (t+1)/(t+f+3) notes are played, and this must be greater than or equal to p.
Using this, any rational value of p between 0 and 1 can be accommodated.</p>
</div>


<h2>Constraint #2: Limitation in Number of Simultaneous Notes</h2>
<p>We want the number of notes that can be played simultaneously in the arrangement to be limited to j. While this reduction is similar to the first, it will use X3SAT, which will be explained later. First, we can define the specific constraints of this problem</p>
<ul>
<li>Each individual part is either included or excluded in its entirety</li>
<li>At any given time, at least p notes in the original song need to be played. For now, assume p = 50%. </li>
<li>The number of simultaneous notes in the arrangement is no more than j. The number of notes is j ≥ 1.</li>
</ul>
<p>The authors show that arranging under this constraint is NP-hard using a reduction from 3SAT or X3SAT. X3SAT is a modification to the 3SAT problem where exactly one literal in any clause has to be true.</p>

<h4>True and False Literals</h4>
<p>A true literal can be created similarly to the process in the previous reduction. However, the false literal is different because we need to use it to create the variable gadget. So, first we will construct j true literals. A false literal can then be made by having a measure with the j true literals and the false literal. Since all of the true literals must be selected and only j notes can be played, the note in the false part cannot be played.</p>
<h4>Variable Gadgets</h4>
<p>We will make two parts for each variable: a true value and a false value. </p>
<ul>
<li>If j = 1:</li>
<p>We can make a variable gadget by having a measure with both true and false versions of the variable. We can only play one note, so at most one of these parts must be played. We also need to play at least one of these notes since we must play at least p of the notes being played at this time.</p>
<li>If j = 2:</li>
<p>We can make a variable gadget by having one true and some number of false literals. We can play at most two notes and one must be the true literal, so we can only play at most one of the true or false parts for the variable. Similarly to how the clause gadget was generalized, we need to pad the variable gadget with enough false literals to ensure that the requirement of p notes being played requires the true part and one of the variable parts to be played.</p>
<li>For any j:</li>
<p>Add j-1 true parts and sufficiently many false literals.</p>
</ul>
<h4>Clause Gadget</h4>
<p>If j = 1 and 0 < p ≤ 1/3 , we can make a clause gadget with a measure with three literals in the clause. Because of the restraints on p, we must play at least one note. Since j = 1, we also can play at most one note. So, in order for the clause to be playable, one and only one variable can be true. This makes the reduction to X3SAT more clear.</p>
<p>For higher values of j, we can pad the clause with j-1 true literals. We can show that the problem is NP-hard by the same reduction when (j-1)/(j+2) < p ≤ j/(j+2). In this case, we must select the j-1 true literals and a single one of the variables.</p>
<p>To further generalize the problem, we can add false literals at higher values of j. Let us pad the clause with f false literals. Then, we can use the same clause gadget for (j-1)/(j+2+f) < p ≤ j/(j+2+f). If we combine all possible regions shown hard for various numbers of false literals, the problem is hard for any p, 0 < p ≤ j/(j+2).</p>
<h4>Polynomial Cases within the Constraint</h4>
<ul>
<li>If p > j/(j+1), the problem is solvable in polynomial time.</li>
<p>This is because for all notes played at the same time in the original, the arrangement would need to play all of the parts containing the notes or it is impossible to make an arrangement. Consider if we had j = 1. This would make our p > ½. If the original piece contained 2 notes at one time, according to our simultaneous note constraint we can only play 1 of these notes. However, because p > ½, we would also be required to play both notes. So, if p > j/(j+1) we cannot make a valid arrangement.</p>
<li>If j=1 and p > ⅓, the problem is solvable in polynomial time because of a reduction to 2 coloring.</li>
<p>Suppose we have a moment in the original song with N playable notes. If N ≥ 3, the piece could not be played because we would not be able to play enough notes while satisfying j = 1. So if we have N = 1, we must play that note. If N = 2, we must choose a single one of those notes. We can create a graph using each part in the original piece as a node. Then we can create an edge between two nodes when the two parts have notes at the same time. Checking for a valid two coloring (Where one color is not playing a part and the other color is playing a part) is equivalent to the problem.</p>
</ul>

<!-- THIRD REDUCTION HERE -->
<h2>Constraint #3: Transition Speed</h2>
<p>Finally, we don’t want the notes to move too quickly since there is a limit on how fast human musicians can change notes. The specific constraint of this problem was arbitratilily decided by the
  authors to mean that every note must be played for a minimum of two beats (a half note). This can be generalized by dividing the length of each note and rest by a constant. Finally, like previously, we assume p=50%.
</p>
<h4>Variable Gadget</h4>
<p>We can use a time signature with 8 beats per measure to simplify visualization. Then the variable gadget can still be created by adding two parts per variable to represent true and false.
  So that only one part is selected, in one measure we have the true variable start playing a half-note on the third beat and the false variable start playing a half-note on the fourth beat.
  In addition, we need the true part to play a note throughout the entire measure in order to satisfy p=50%. Otherwise, both the true and false variables will be played, breaking the transition speed constraint.
  Therefore, X1 might be a note at beat three and !X1 a note a beat 3, showing that both a variable and its negation can't be played at the same time.
</p>
<h4>True and False Literals</h4>
<p>The true literal can be created in the same way as the previous reductions. The false literal is created by adding another true literal to the existing one that plays throughout the measure.
  Therefore, the third part cannot be played, and represents the false literal.
As a reminder, p can be generalized by adding more true literals.</p>
<h4>Clause Gadget</h4>
<p>Fortunately, the same clause gadget from the consonance reduction applies here; see  above.</p>


<h2>General Results</h2>
<h4>Arranging music is in NP</h4>
<p>Arranging music is in NP regardless of which constraints are considered. This can be shown by existence of polynomial time algorithm which checks whether an arrangement is valid or not. The algorithm is done by iterating through all times that notes are played and checking that all constraints are being met.</p>

<h4>Requiring all 100% of notes played is P</h4>
<p>The problem of arranging music when all notes played in the original song need to be played in the arrangement is polynomial-time solvable(regardless of constraints considered). This is because the only possible arrangement includes all the notes, which just need to be checked by the polynomial-time checking algorithm.</p>

<h4>Requiring 0% of notes played is P</h4>
<p>The problem of arranging music when none of the notes played in the original song need to be played in the arrangement is polynomial-time solvable(regardless of constraints considered).The solution to this is to have an arrangement with no notes, which is clearly solvable in polynomial time.</p>

<h2>Applications</h2>
<ul>
<li>Direct applications for these proofs include the creation of music for games like Rock Band or Guitar Hero since in these games, the original piece of music has to be arranged for the fake guitar in the game. This application is better suited for the problem when the number of notes is limited since the fake guitar only has five buttons.</li>
<li>This can extend to rhythm gaming in general where the input device represents the instrument, such as the pad for dance dance revolution or buttons for tap tap revolution. As a result, we can claim that designing arrangements for all rhythm gaming is NP-hard.</li>
<li>In the same way, we can claim that any form of musical choreography, like ballet and ice skating, is NP-hard. In this scenario, the choreography represents the instrument, and various moves represent the notes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Discussion</h2>
<h4>Currently disregards rhythm</h4>
<ul>
<li>These constraints only deal with pitch. We are focusing on which notes are being played at the same time, but not the relationship between the separate times. This can raise a lot of other questions - how often should we be allowed to change the tempo before the melody becomes unrecognizable?</li>
</ul>
<h4>Application to Piano Tiles</h4>
<ul>
<li>Piano Tiles is a popular app where the player must tap different rectangles as they pass down the screen. At one time, there can be a maximum of four rectangles that must be pressed. The rhythm of the tiles corresponds to the rhythm of the music, where the tiles will change more frequently as the game gets more difficult. The paper tells us that choosing an arrangement of tiles for one song at one difficulty setting is NP-complete, so there is no efficient way to do this.</li>
<li>This problem takes the simultaneous notes and transition speed limitations into account, since there is a maximum on the number of rectangles and it is impossible for a player to press the rectangles if they are moving at a certain speed. However, consonance is not an issue in this game since the same music will play regardless of the arrangement. A dissonant chord will only play if the player makes a mistake.</li>
</ul>
