## Course Materials
There is no required textbook for the course. However, there are several recommended books that some students may find helpful:

- Sipser, Michael. [Introduction to the Theory of Computation](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL2927330W/Introduction_to_the_theory_of_computation?edition=introductiontoth00sips){target="_blank"}. Course Technology, 2006. ISBN: 9780534950972. (**Note:** *there is a newer edition available, but it is not necessary - the 2nd edition will suffice.*)
-	Moore, Cristopher and Stephan Mertens. [The Nature of Computation](http://nature-of-computation.org/){target="_blank"}. Oxford University Press, 2011. ISBN: 9780199233212.
-	Arora, Sanjeev and Boaz Barak. [Computational Complexity: A Modern Approach](http://theory.cs.princeton.edu/complexity/){target="_blank"}. Cambridge University Press, 2009. ISBN: 9780521424264. 
- Critchlow, Carol and David Eck. [Foundations of Computation](http://math.hws.edu/FoundationsOfComputation/){target="_blank"}. Available free online.

## Communication expectations
All written communication regarding this course will take place via [slack](https://smi-csc250-01-202103.slack.com){target="_blank"} (a cloud-based team
collaboration tool used by many tech companies for internal communication). This includes:

- announcements (in the [#general](https://smi-csc250-01-202103.slack.com/archives/C01JQ49R11V){target="_blank"} channel)
- questions about the material (in the [#questions](https://smi-csc250-01-202103.slack.com/archives/C01KP1BLX1R){target="_blank"} channel)
- messages between individual students and the instructor (via DM to @jordan)

Email is hard to search, response rate is slow, and messages are likely to get lost. Use slack!

## Assignments
There will be 8 problem sets assigned during the semester. Problem sets will be due by 5pm on Thursday evenings. These problem sets will often ask you to prove theorems, but it is more important to demonstrate understanding than to employ rigor for rigor's sake. For example: a brief description of an algorithm including an illustrative diagram is better than complicated spaghetti code. Additionally, a clear explanation of how you tried to solve a problem and were unsuccessful will receive partial credit. All assignment submissions must be in PDF format, and must be organized and legible (typed is preferable). A [LaTeX template](https://moodle.smith.edu/mod/resource/view.php?id=682230){target="_blank"} is available for typesetting your assignments.

## Collaboration and Academic Integrity
Students are strongly encouraged to form study groups and to collaborate on problem sets, though each student will be required to write up and submit their solutions independently. The following information is required for all submitted work:

1.	The names of all collaborating students be listed at the top of the submission. If you worked alone, please state: "*I did not collaborate with anyone on this assignment.*"
2. A "**References**" section, with in-line citations to any resources you used. Citations should include page numbers (if a printed resource) or a direct URL (if an online resource). If you did not use any resources in completing the assignment, please state: "*I did not utilize any external resources in completing this assignment.*"

<hr>
## Examinations and Projects
There will be two take-home final examinations, and one (low-stakes) final project in this course. The project may be conducted independently, or in a small group.

## Policy on Late Work

Submissions received after the posted deadline will incur a penalty of **-10% per day for up to three days** (after which they will be ineligible for credit). Unless otherwise specified as part of a student's documented accommodations, requests for extensions outside of the three-day grace period will be granted only under the following conditions: the request is made in writing (via Slack DM to the instructor) at least 48 hours in advance of the due date (or) the professor has been notified by the student's dean that the student requires an extension for personal or health reasons.

## Accommodation
Smith is committed to providing support services and reasonable accommodations to all students with disabilities. To request an accommodation, please register with the Disability Services Office at the beginning of the semester. To do so, call (413) 585-2071 to arrange an appointment with Laura Rauscher, Director of Disability Services. 

<mark>**COVID-19 Policy Update**<br/>
I am acutely aware that the shift to remote instruction may require accommodations that have not previously been verified by Disability Services (e.g. increased screen time may exacerbate eye strain, etc.) Please know that I am committed to figuring this out together. If there's something I can do to make this material more accessible for you and you have the spoons to do so, please bring it to my attention.</mark>
