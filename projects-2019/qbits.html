<h3>What <em>are</em> quantum computers?</h3>

To understand quantum computers, we must first understand regular computers. 
Regular computers, at their most fundamental level, operate on binary bits (1s and 0s).
Those bits can be used to perform mathmatical operations, and those operations can be
built upon to perform more complex tasks (like parsing an html page). 
Quantum computers, in contrast to this, use <em>quantum</em> bits (or, "qubits").
Where regular bits only have 2 states (on and off), qubits have 3 (on, off, and... both).


<h3>How do qubits work?</h3>
Qubits work on the same principle as Schrodinger's cat in that they are both on AND off at
the same time UNTIL they are observed. Once observed, this changes. This phenomenon is known
as "superposition".

<h3>Why does this make quantum computers so fast?</h3>
In her article "How Does Quantum Computing Work?", Marianne Freiberger explains it best:
<br>
"Imagine a line of people waiting at the gates of heaven to see whether they'll be let in. 
Guarding those gates is Saint Peter who, in deference to his love for computer science, has 
labelled all the people with numbers written in binary. There happen to be exactly 23 = 8 people, 
which means that each person gets their own unique string of three 0s and 1s. Peter records 
his decisions by allocating a 1 to a particular bit-string if he is going to let the 
corresponding person in, and a 0 if he's not. You don't know what Peter is going to decide to 
do with each individual, but you do know that he's set in his ways: he'll either let everybody 
in (every bit-string gets allocated a 1), or he will let exactly half the people in (half of 
bit-strings get allocated a 0 and the other half a 1). You task is, not to find out what 
happens to each individual, but whether Peter is in a generous mood and lets everybody in, 
or whether he is in a grumpy mood, deciding to let only half of the people in. How many values 
of Peter's Boolean function do you need to look up to find out which of the two alternatives it is?
<br>
If you work like a classical computer, then in the worst-case scenario you'll have to look the 
function up five times. That's because even if you see a 1 allocated to the first 4 bit-strings 
you check, you still can't be sure that all the bit-strings come with a 1: there is still the 
possibility that it's only half of them, so you do need that 5th look-up. If you have a quantum 
computer, however, you can get it to look up the function value for all the eight people 
simultaneously, so you only need one look-up. 'For the cost of running the program once with 
this funny superposition input, you have somehow computed all the [values at once]' ...
This advantage of quantum over classical computation becomes even more apparent when there are 
more people: for a line consisting of 2n individuals, a classical computer would need to look up 
the function 2n-1+1 times, a number that grows very quickly with n. A quantum computer would 
always only need to look once.”
<br>
This kind of behavior was first posited by scientists Deutsch and Jozsa (see Marianne Freiberger's article for more details on that), and it's that ability
to look up every value <em>simultaneously</em> that makes quantum computers so dang fast when
it comes to performing certain mathmatical operations-- including, for example, factorization.

<h3>How does this affect cyber security?</h3>
Cyber security is rooted in our ability to encrypt messages, and that encryption is in turn
rooted in what's known as "public key cryptography" (PKC). PKC operates off of the 
fact that certain problems are <em>so</em> difficult that they cannot be solved in any reasonable amount
of time. Most notably, we have the example of prime number factorization.
It is easy to multiply two very large prime numbers together; it is incredibly difficult to then factor 
those numbers back out. Or at least, it <em>should</em> be very difficult-- but this falls under 
one of the tasks which a quantum computer should theoretically be able to perform.
By doing just that, quantum computers would very literally obliterate the encryption measures we 
currently rely on.

<h3>How worried should we be?</h3>
Very! But not until roughly 2030 to 2040, as estimated by experts in the article "Quantum Computers 
Will Break the Encryption That Protects the Internet", published by <em>The Economist</em>. As 
it currently stands, quantum computers are still in the infancy of their technological development. 
But the future is coming whether we like it or not, and counter-measures must be established
before that time comes. As offered in that same article by <em>The Economist</em>, there exist
certain kinds of mathmatical operations that a quantum computer CANNOT perform. These include
problems like "supersingular isogenies, structured and unstructured lattices, and multivariate polynomials" (<em>The Economist</em>).
The hard part is going to be disseminating this information, as the internet is such a 
patchwork creation with no single authority figure to give commands. In the meantime, it may 
be smart to simply start hiding your money under your mattress again.
